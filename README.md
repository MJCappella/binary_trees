# Binary Tree Implementation in C
Welcome to the Binary Tree Implementation in C repository! This repository contains C code for creating and manipulating binary trees. Binary trees are a fundamental data structure that consists of nodes, each having at most two children â€“ a left and a right child.

# Overview
This repository provides a simple and modular implementation of binary trees in the C programming language. The code includes basic functionalities such as insertion, deletion, traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order), and searching. The aim is to serve as a learning resource and foundation for understanding and working with binary trees in C.
